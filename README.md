# Obsidian-MinimalQuiz

Obsidian-MinimalQuiz is the simplest quiz plugin for Obsidian. Define questions directly in your Markdown filesâ€”no extra setup required. Just write, quiz, and learn!

## Features
- **Minimalistic**: No complex UI, just Markdown-based quizzes.
- **Intuitive Syntax**: Questions end with `?`, followed by the answer on the next line.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works directly within Obsidian notes.

## How It Works
Write your quiz questions in a Markdown file like this:

```
What is the capital of France?
Paris

Who wrote "1984"?
George Orwell
```

The plugin will automatically detect the questions and present them in quiz format.

## Installation
